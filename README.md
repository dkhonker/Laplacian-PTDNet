This is a Tensorflow implementation of paper: <b>Learning to Drop: Robust Graph Neural Network via Topological Denoising</b>

<i>WSDM'21</i>

I've updated the code from Tensorflow 1.0 to Tensorflow 2.0.
Currently, I only provide sample implementation for reference. 
Hyper-parameters for different datasets need tune.I will keep updating this repo.
